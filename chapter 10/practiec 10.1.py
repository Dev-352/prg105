# Design a class that holds the following personal data: name, address, age, and phone number.
# Write appropriate accessor and mutator methods (get and set). Write a program that creates three
# instances of the class. One instance should hold your information and the other two should hold your friends'
# or family members' information.  Just add information, don't get it from the user.  Print the data from each object,
# make sure to format the output for clarity and ease of reading.
